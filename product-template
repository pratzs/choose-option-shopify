In the Sections directory, click product-template.liquid.

Find the following code:

{% assign current_variant = product.selected_or_first_available_variant %}
Replace it with:

{% assign current_variant = product.selected_variant %}
Find the following code:

selected="selected"
Delete the above code, along with the Liquid logic tags that surround it. The code to be deleted looks like this:

{% if variant == product.selected_or_first_available_variant %} selected="selected" {% endif %}
